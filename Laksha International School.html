<h3><font color=blue><u>About us</u></font>:</h3><br>
<h4>Our school's mission is to learn leadership, the common core, and relationships for life.<br>
Our mission is to provide a safe, disciplined learning environment that empowers all students to develop<br> 
their full potential. We feel strongly about helping to build leaders that have the ability to succeed in whatever<br> 
endeavor they undertake. Winning is not always the measure of success. Our students understand<br> 
the "Win, win" philosophy and use it in their daily life. Common standards keeps us focused on<br> 
learning appropriate content and preparing our students to graduate. Last but just as importantly, setting<br>
examples for our students of meaningful and lasting relationships will go with them throughout their lifetime.</h4><br>
